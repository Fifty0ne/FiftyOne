                    <p>A common misconception of development is that we work in isolation and are solely focused on writing code. In reality, we are highly collaborative professionals who work very closely with our partners to understand requirements and ensure the final product meets user needs. Working hard to be able to remain proud of everything we produce and what The Distance stands for.</p>

                    <p>As a business, The Distance empower our staff to be able to make their role their own; run with ideas and spot opportunities for improvements. And while they'll be given plenty of support if they need it, no one is going to hold their hand while they're getting on with the job. Our business model is one that looks beyond just hitting the numbers on a quarterly basis, We invest for the long term too, and that means taking big bets when it feels right. We invest in people who have the courage to take bets on themselves.</p>
